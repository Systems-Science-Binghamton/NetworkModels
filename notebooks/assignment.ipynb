    "Some useful tips about $k$-core decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $k$-core decomposition is a quite useful tool in practice to downsize the network. Many empirical networks are notoriously large, and it is often impossible to analyze with a given computing capacity at hand. A remedy is to focus on the $k$-core of the network since most edges are held by the nodes in the large-degree nodes. Since most nodes have a small degree in many empirical networks, using a moderately small $k$ can drastically reduce the size of the network.\n",
